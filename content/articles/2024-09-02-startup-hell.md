2021 was a different time. Silicon Valley Bank had yet to implode, venture capitalists were still handing out rolls of cash like they grew on trees; debt was cheap, and the myth of the tech billionaire saviour was still just about viable. It was a far-cry from the superlative era of tech-startups in the 2010s, and the dizzying fantasies about tech revolutions had been tempered somewhat, but the shine was still on the apple, albeit with a few yellow spots and squishy bits developing.

Since then, we've seen banks fail, bubbles burst, interest rates soar, and headcounts slashed; the golden era of shoestring startups backed by keyed-up VCs has definitely come to an end, and we've walked through the bright lights and music of the funfair into the arid desert beyond, all of that now just a faint ringing in our ears.

It was during this twilight era that I went out to find a new job as a software engineer. My first gig as a software developer had come in 2019, when I was hired at above market rate by a finance company in London who, despite my constant disbelief, seemed impatient to get me, specifically me, on staff as soon as possible.

Two years, one promotion, one pandemic, and six (yes, six) line managers later, I threw in the towel and left. This was largely down to the company's lack of strategic technical direction*, complete lack of attention paid to technical excellence, the loss of some key players on staff, the imminent departure of a colleague whom I respect tremendously, and general failure to provide a promising future for the people it employed. When it became clear that one of our most senior engineers was about to be pushed out of the company, I remember saying to a friend of mine in the Product team: 'I don't see how anything is going to get better with them gone.' I didn't, and I was right in that assessment.

(* This is not strictly true. The company sacked the previous CTO and replaced them with a new CTO and a Lead Architect. Their answer to the company's technical problems was to rebuild all the company's in-house software... in Clojure.)

Periodically, I receive a message on LinkedIn from a former colleague still at the company, either ruing their choice to stay, or asking my advice on a particularly difficult piece of software, or a particularly difficult member of staff. The last cry for help I received was almost a year ago, so I'm considering that door firmly shut, silence on the other side resounding.

From the beureaucratically-stifling flush finance company with a truly eye-watering AWS bill, I joined a seat-of-the-pants startup (also in finance) gearing up for another funding round. In two blistering years, I went from a lowly senior telematics engineer on a team of four, to tech lead for the company's core platform team, line-managing several talented engineers, and ultimately responsible for the heart of the business's technical capabilities. I survived two rounds of redundancies unscathed, a buy-out by a larger company, three or more team restructures, and the departure of most of the original crew.

I spent three years in that company, and I can still scarcely believe that in the first two years, I went from a lowly engineer tinkering with telematics data, to tech lead and manager for the company's core platform team. To this day I still can't understand why companies seem to keen to hire and promote me; a feature of my personality is an inate distrust of positive feedback, so I naturally assume that I am a useful idiot these companies needed to keep around, or perhaps it was less expensive to keep someone barely passable on staff rather than risk going out to market.

[CUT THIS] In the brief moments when I can afford retrospection, when I have unsettling moments of clarity, I look back at my 17-year-old self in 2008, watching the global economy collapse, going through the usual battery of teenage angst and depression, and think: 'what would he have thought about this version of himself, 16 years in the future?' On paper, describing the role I previously held in those terms, I think he would have been excited and terrified.
