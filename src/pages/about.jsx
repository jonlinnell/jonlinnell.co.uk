          I'm a software 'engineer', with a value/delivery-oriented mindset and a commitment to
          solid coding standards. (i.e. I'm not afraid of writing tests.)
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          I have a Communications BSc with a diploma in International Studies, and a life-long love
          of code and nerd-related stuff.

          My language of choice is <InlineHighlight>TypeScript</InlineHighlight>.

          I can get by in <InlineHighlight>Python</InlineHighlight>, am generally proficient in
          shell scripting languages, IaC frameworks such as{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>Terraform</InlineHighlight>, a small amount of{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>Rust</InlineHighlight>, and I know just enough{" "}

          My longest-running application still out in the wild is a website and bespoke CMS for
          sharing conference talks for a venue in my hometown. It is a server-rendered monolithic
          monstrosity that I wrote mainly in Perl when I was a teenager and did not know any better.
          That said, it's still running 15 years later with barely any maintenance.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          More recently, I build solutions to complex business problems reaching wide audiences,
          using modern approaches like cloud infrastructure, serverless computing, containerisation,
          event-driven architectures, and fancy light-on-dark colour schemes.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          I'm conversationally proficient in French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. I have varying basic levels of Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸,
          Polish ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, Mandarin Chinese ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, Swedish ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª, and Finnish ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®. I'm still working on my
          English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.

          I can also be found exploring cities wielding one of my SLRs. You can see some of my
          photography <a href="#">here</a>, when I get around to that part of the site.
