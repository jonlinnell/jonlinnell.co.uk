          I'm a software engineer with a focus on value delivery and a commitment to solid coding

          My longest-running application still out in the wild is a website and bespoke CMS for
          sharing conference talks for a venue in my hometown. It is a server-rendered monolithic
          monstrosity that I wrote mainly in Perl when I was a teenager and did not know any better.
          That said, it's still running 15 years later with barely any maintenance.

          using modern approaches like cloud infrastructure, serverless computing, containerisation,
          event-driven architectures, and fancy light-on-dark colour schemes.
