                      My current role comprises management of IT facilities and support at
                      Loughborough University&apos;s London campus. My primary responsibility
                      is guaranteeing an excellent level of IT provision and support to staff,
                      researchers, and students, employing my extensive interests and

                      Taking up the post just a month prior to the opening of the new campus in
                      London, I was involved in the planning, deployment, and on-going support
                      of the new services and systems being provisioned to the new campus. When
                      the London campus moved from its temporary home to its permanent building,
                      I was tasked with maintaining IT service continuity, and ensuring a
                      coordinated effort by all parties to execute the move effectively.

                      I am often called upon to utilise my wider skills and expertise to augment
                      my work. My other professional interests include audiovisual systems, web

                      I have been able to use as part of my role.
