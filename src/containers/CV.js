                post="Senior Support Officer for IT"
                location="London, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§"
              >
                <p>My current role comprises management and oversight of the IT services, facilities, and associated support structures at Loughborough University's London campus. My primary responsibilities are guaranteeing an excellent level of IT provision and technical support to staff and students, and employing my extensive interests and experiences in IT for the benefit of our staff, students, and the campus as a whole.</p>
                <p>Taking up the post just a month prior to the opening of the new campus in London, I was involved in the planning, deployment, and on-going support of the new services and systems being provisioned to the new campus. When the London campus moved from its temporary home to its permanent building, I was tasked with maintaining IT service continuity, and ensuring a coordinated effort by all parties to execute the move effectively.</p>
                <p>I have an excellent knowledge of HE policy, procedure, systems, and internal mechanisms, and I am often called upon to utilise my skills and expertise to improve and integrate technical aspects into these. My wider interests include audiovisual systems, web development, digital content production, and graphic design, all of which I have been able to use as part of my role.</p>

                <p>I previously worked in first-line support for Loughborough University's PC Clinic, a popular face-to-face helpdesk service for staff and students.</p>
                <p>Alongside my regular support duties, I was involved in the implementation of an extensive, campus-wide telephony infrastructure upgrade from an analogue network to a VoIP system. I was part of the team performing the upgrades at the consumer level, while working with the department to maintain service continuity. My duties included coordinating logistics, configuring hardware, liaising with departments to schedule upgrades, and providing aftercare.</p>
